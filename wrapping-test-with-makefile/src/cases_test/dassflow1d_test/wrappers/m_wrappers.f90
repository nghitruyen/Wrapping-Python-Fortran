!  This file is part of the DassFlow software (Data Assimilation for Free Surface Flows).
!  DassFlow is a computational software aiming at simulating geophysical free surface flows.
!  It is designed for Variational Data Assimilation (4D-var) and sensitivity analyses. 
! Inverse capabilities are based on the adjoint code which is generated by 
! a source-to-source algorithmic differentiation (Tapenade software used).
!
!  DassFlow software includes few mostly independent "modules" with common architectures and structures:
!    - DassFlow 2DShallow (shallow water equations in (h,q), finite volumes), i.e. the present code.
!    - DassFlow3D  (non-linear Stokes equations, finite elements, mobile geometries, ALE).
!    - DassFlow 1D (shallow water equations in (S,Q), finite volumes or finite differences), river hydraulics.
!  Please consult the DassFlow webpage for more details: http://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/DassFlow
