  abstract = {{Numerous codes are being developed to solve Shallow Water equations.
	Because there are used in hydraulic and environmental studies, their
	capability to simulate properly flow dynamics is critical to guarantee
	infrastructure and human safety. While validating these codes is
	an important issue, code validations are currently restricted because
	analytic solutions to the Shallow Water equations are rare and have
	been published on an individual basis over a period of more than
	five decades. This article aims at making analytic solutions to the
	Shallow Water equations easily available to code developers and users.
	It compiles a significant number of analytic solutions to the Shallow
	Water equations that are currently scattered through the literature
	of various scientific disciplines. The analytic solutions are described
	in a unified formalism to make a consistent set of test cases. These
	analytic solutions encompass a wide variety of flow conditions (supercritical,
	subcritical, shock, etc.), in 1 or 2 space dimensions, with or without
	rain and soil friction, for transitory flow or steady state. The
	corresponding source codes are made available to the community (http://www.univ-orleans.fr/mapmo/soft/SWASHES),
	so that users of Shallow Water-based models can easily find an adaptable
	benchmark library to validate their numerical methods.}},

  abstract = {{This paper presents a new functionality of the Automatic Differentiation
	(AD) tool Tapenade. Tapenade generates adjoint codes which are widely
	used for optimization or inverse problems. Unfortunately, for large
	applications the adjoint code demands a great deal of memory, because
	it needs to store a large set of intermediates values. To cope with
	that problem, Tapenade implements a sub-optimal version of a technique
	called checkpointing, which is a trade-off between storage and recomputation.
	Our long-term goal is to provide an optimal checkpointing strategy
	for every code, not yet achieved by any AD tool. Towards that goal,
	we first introduce modifications in Tapenade in order to give the
	user the choice to select the checkpointing strategy most suitable
	for their code. Second, we conduct experiments in real-size scientific
	codes in order to gather hints that help us to deduce an optimal
	checkpointing strategy. Some of the experimental results show memory
	savings up to 35\% and execution time up to 90\%.}},

	especially designed for variational data assimilation. The forward
	model is based on the bidimensional shallow-water equations, solved
	by a finite volume method (HLLC approximate Riemann solver). It is
	written in Fortran 95. The adjoint code is generated by the automatic
	differentiation tool Tapenade. Thus, Dassflow software includes the
	forward solver, its adjoint code, the full optimization framework
	(based on the M1QN3 minimization routine) and benchmarks. The generation
	of new data assimilation twin experiments is easy. The software is
	interfaced with few pre and post-processors (mesh generators, GIS
	tools and visualization tools), which allows to treat real data.}},

	frictional shallow flows over complex domains involving wetting and
	drying. The proposed scheme solves, in a finite volume Godunov-type
	framework, a set of pre-balanced shallow water equations derived
	by considering pressure balancing. Non-negative reconstruction of
	Riemann states and compatible discretization of slope source term
	produce stable and well-balanced solutions to shallow flow hydrodynamics
	over complex topography. The friction source term is discretized
	using a splitting implicit scheme. Limiting value of the friction
	force is derived to ensure stability. This new numerical scheme is
	validated against four theoretical benchmark tests and then applied
	to reproduce a laboratory dam break over a domain with irregular
	bed profile.}},
